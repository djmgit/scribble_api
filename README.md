## Scribble API

This repository hosts the backend API for Sribbble. This API has been used to build [Scribble CLI](https://github.com/djmgit/scribble) and [Scribble chrome extension](https://github.com/djmgit/scribble_web_extension).

## What is Scribble

Scribble is primarily a terminal based note taking application for devs. It allow us to create notes, view existing notes,
search existing notes, delete notes from the terminal itself. We can take note while working on terminal without switching to
any other web based or desktop based application.
